### Code highlight

```bash
npm i -S hexo-prism-plugin

Then,modify the value of `highlight.enable` to `false` in `_config.yml` file of Hexo root folder，and add the configuration of `prism` plugin as follows:

```yaml
highlight:
  enable: false

prism_plugin:
  mode: 'preprocess'    # realtime/preprocess
  theme: 'tomorrow'
  line_number: false    # default false

```

Add configuration of `_config.yml` file in Hexo root folder as follows：

```

### Translate Chinese Link to Pinyin (Optional)

Defualt permalinks of Hexo will include Chinese if your atrticle's title is Chinese.But it's adverse to `SEO`,and `gitment` comments don't suport Chinese Link as well.We can use the [hexo-permalink-pinyin](https://github.com/viko16/hexo-permalink-pinyin) of Hexo plugin to generate permalinks of Chinese Pinyin  when generating posts.

Installation commands are as follows：

```bash
npm i hexo-permalink-pinyin --save
```

Add such configurations in `_config.yml` file of  Hexo:

```yaml
permalink_pinyin:
  enable: true
  separator: '-' # default: '-'
```

> **Note*:[hexo-abbrlink](https://github.com/rozbo/hexo-abbrlink) can genarate non-Chinese link in addtion to this plugin.

### Add RSS feed support (Optional)

The theme uses the Hexo plugin[hexo-generator-feed](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-feed) to support `RSS` feed , and the Installation commands are as follows:

```bash
npm install hexo-generator-feed --save
```

Add configuration of `_config.yml` file in Hexo root folder as follows：

```yaml
feed:
  type: atom
  path: atom.xml
  limit: 20
  hub:
  content:
  content_limit: 140
  content_limit_delim: ' '
  order_by: -date
```

Execute `hexo clean && hexo g` to regenerate the blog file, and then you can see the `atom.xml` file in the `public` folder, indicating that you have successfully installed.

### Modify social links

In the `/layout/_partial/social-link.ejs` file of the theme, you can modify or add the social link address you need. To add a link, please refer to the following code:

```html
<a href="https://github.com/blinkfox" class="tooltipped" target="_blank" data-tooltip="访问我的GitHub" data-position="top" data-delay="50">
    <i class="fa fa-github"></i>
</a>
```

You can search social icon such as `fa-github` in [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons).There are common social icons you can reference:

- Facebook: `fa-facebook`
- Twitter: `fa-twitter`
- Google-plus: `fa-google-plus`

## Post Front-matter example

title: typora-vue-theme Theme introduction
date: 2018-09-07 09:25:00
author: Qi Zhao
img: /source/images/xxx.jpg # or:http://xxx.com/xxx.jpg
top: true # If top value is true, it will be the homepage recommendation post
# If you want to set the reading verification password for the post, 
# you can set the password value, which must be encrypted with SHA256 to prevent others from seeing it.
password: 8d969eef6ecad3c29a3a629280e686cf0c3f5d5a86aff3ca12020c923adc6c92
# Does this post open mathjax, Need to be activated in the theme's _config.yml.
mathjax: false
categories: Markdown
tags:
  - Typora
  - Markdown
---
```

> **Note**: 
> 1. post's featured piature will take remainder if not writing the `img` property,and chose the featured picture of theme to let all of post's picture **have their own characteristics**.
> 2. The value of `date` should try to ensure that each article is unique, because `Gitalk` and `Gitment` recognize `id` in this topic are uniquely identified by the value of `date`.
> 3. If you want to set the ability to read the verification password for the article, you should not only set the value of the password with SHA256 encryption in Front-matter, but also activate the configuration in the theme `_config.yml`.

## Custom modification

You can modify some custom modification in `_config.yml` as follows:

- Menu
- Inspirational quotes on Home
- Whether to display the title of the recommended posts
- `favicon` and `Logo`
- profiles
- TOC
- post rewards
- My Projects
- My Skills
- My Gallery
- Gitalk, Gitment, Valine and Disqus
- The map of default featured pictures. The theme will take remainde according to `hashcode` of post title if the post dose not set featured piactures.

**I think everyone should have their own style and feature of blog**。if you are not satisfiled with functions and theme color,you can modify by yourself,and more free functions and deatil need to be modified by modify source code when it is hard to be finished in `_config.yml`.

### modeing theme color

Search `.bg-color` to modify background color in `/source/css/matery.css` in theme file：

```css
/* The overall background color, including navigation, mobile navigation, footer, tab, etc.. */
.bg-color {
    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #4cbf30 0%, #0f9d58 100%);
}

/* The color of the text with the same background color is only used in one place on the front page. You can also apply it to other places.*/
.text-color {
    color: #0f9d58 !important;
}

@-webkit-keyframes rainbow {
   /* Dynamically switch background colors. */
}

@keyframes rainbow {
    /* Dynamically switch background colors. */
}
```

### Modify banner picture and post's featured pictures

You can change `banner` pictures in `/source/medias/banner` as you like .Theme code can switch  dynamically every day and just need 7 pictures.If you master `JavaScript`,you can change it to your favorite swithing logic,such as Random switching.The code of switching `banner`is in `<script></script>` of `/layout/_partial/bg-cover.ejs`file.

```javascript
$('.bg-cover').css('background-image', 'url(/medias/banner/' + new Date().getDay() + '.jpg)');
```

There are 24 featured pictures in `/source/medias/featureimages`,you can add or delete,and modify it in `_config.yml` at the sametime.
